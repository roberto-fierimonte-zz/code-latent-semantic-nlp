# Semantic Latent Natural Language Modelling

This repository contains the code for a Natural Langauge generative model in which we try to encode the semantic of the text into a latent variable, leaving the syntactical part to be handled by a Recursive Neural Network.

The code in this repository is partially based on the code from AUTRWords by Harshil Shah.
