# Semantic Latent Natural Language Modelling/AutoGen

This repository contains the code for extensions of the Natural Langauge generative model from [Bowman et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349).

At first we try to encode the semantic of the text into a latent variable, leaving the syntactical part to be handled by a Recursive Neural Network.

Subsequently we implement the AutoGen training procedure detailed in [Mansbridge et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04480).

The code in this repository is used and cited in my dissertation for the MRes programme in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL, with David Barber as supervisor.
